# Astroid Destroyer

Astroid Destroyer is a lightweight and powerful security testing tool designed to detect Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications.  
It can scan both GET and POST parameters, test with built-in or custom payloads, and identify reflected and DOM-based XSS issues.  

With features like multi-threading, proxy support, detailed verbose logging, timeout and retry options, prefix/suffix payload markers, custom headers, and JSON report generation, Astroid Destroyer combines speed and simplicity.

## Features

- Detects reflected XSS vulnerabilities in GET and POST parameters  
- Detects potential DOM-based XSS issues by analyzing scripts and sinks (`innerHTML`, `eval`, `document.write`, etc.)  
- Supports custom payloads from a file (`--payloads`)  
- Automatic prefix/suffix markers to improve detection and reduce false negatives  
- Multi-threaded scanning for faster results  
- Retry failed requests and set custom timeouts (`--retries`, `--timeout`)  
- Proxy support (Burp Suite / OWASP ZAP integration)  
- Custom headers: User-Agent, Cookie, Referer  
- Verbose/debug mode to trace scanning steps (`-v`)  
- JSON report output for structured results (`--report`)  
- Lightweight and easy to run on any system

## Usage

### Basic Scan
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/index.php?q=test"
```

### Scan with POST Data
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/login.php" --data "username=admin&password=123"
```

### Use Custom Payload File
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/" --payloads payloads.txt
```

### Set Custom Headers
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/" --ua "CustomUserAgent" --cookie "PHPSESSID=abc123" --referer "http://referrer.com"
```

### Proxy Support
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/" --proxy "http://127.0.0.1:8080"
```

### Verbose Mode (Debugging)
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/" -v
```

### Save Results to JSON
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/" --report results.json
```

### Timeout and Retries
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/" --timeout 30 --retries 3
```

### Multi-threaded Scanning
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://example.com/" --threads 10
```

## Example

Command:
```bash
python astroid_destroyer.py -u "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1" -v
```

Output:
```
* scanning GET parameter 'cat'
  [+] Trying payload: '"><svg/onload=alert(1337)>
  [!] Match found -> possible XSS
Scan completed â€” 1 issue(s) found
```

JSON Report Example:
```json
{
  "url": "http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1",
  "vulns": [
    {
      "param": "cat",
      "method": "GET",
      "payload": "<svg/onload=alert(1337)>",
      "evidence": "...<svg/onload=alert(1337)>..."
    }
  ],
  "dom_like": true
}
```
